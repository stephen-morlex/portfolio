     <p class="tracking-wide text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
       My passion is making ideas come to life, be it working solo, as part of a team or leading a team of fellow developers.

       Throughout my 3 years of development experience, I worked as a freelancer building products from the ground up or implementing new features. Also relevant to my set of skills is that - previously to becoming a developer - I worked as a graphic designer for some of the startup companies, which still helps me to have a more holistic view of the whole work that goes into making a successful visiual presentation. My go-to technologies are Laravel and Vue.js, and I have completed a wide range of projects using them. Those are not the only two libraries/frameworks I'm familiar with though, and I'm always happy to discuss my client's needs and find the best solutions for them. I consider myself creative and hardworking, as my stats show. If you liked my profile so far, drop me a message and we'll discuss how I can be useful to your project.
